<p>Welcome to my page! I'm a very typical trans catgirl nerd, living in
(unfortunately enough) the US. I am (as of 2025) a minor.</p>

<h2>Want more information on my...</h2>

  <summary>identity?</summary>
  <div>
  <p class="extra-margin">
    <b>TL,DR: Exactly what you read earlier. I am a trans catgirl.
    Additionally, I consider myself a lesbian (sort of).</b> If you were to
    ask me at random, I would just say I'm girl.
  </p><p>
    <b>That aside...</b><br>
    specifically, I am <i>genderfaer</i>, meaning I phase through feminine and
    non-binary identities, with the occasional semi-masculine, though never
    <i>fully</i> masculine.
  </p><p>
    <i>as for orientation,</i> it quite well matches my gender. I am
    invariably attracted to women, and variably attracted to men. The
    microlabel for this is <i>neptuniflux</i> (to my understanding).<br>
    Additionally, I am open to both mono- and polyamory.
  </p><p>
    See my <a href="https://cake.avris.it/pC5">Attraction Layer Cake</a> and
    <a href="pronouns.html">pronouns page</a>
    <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@elliouros">(alt, offsite)</a> as well.
    I also loosely consider myself a therian. meow :3

  <p>
    I like <b>math</b>. I also like <b>science</b>, especially the sciences
    that are closely intwined with math. I have a complicated relationship
    with <b>compsci</b>, but overall, I enjoy it.
  </p><p>
    I am also a huge gamer. A few of my favorite games would be Baldur's Gate
    3, ULTRAKILL, Terraria (though I don't play it so much anymore),
    Stardew Valley, Counter Strike 2, Enter the Gungeon- Really, I'll play
    anything until I stop enjoying it.
  </p><p>
    I like to mess with computers- My most recent projects are putting Linux
    on a couple old chromebooks, a home server using an old PC, and putting
    Lakka on a Raspberry Pi. These are all works in progress. Ask me about
    it!
