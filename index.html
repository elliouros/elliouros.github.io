<h1>hiya, i'm ellie</h1>
and what you're seeing now is a temporary structure for this index. this is subject to <b><i>soooo so much</i></b> change and yeah.

<div>
<h2>basic intro...</h2>
as you read before, my name is ellie. or that's what I go by online, for the most part, anyway (my legal name is and will be different).<br>
more information (<a href="pronouns.htm">which will be transcluded soon</a>, if I keep up work on this site) can be found at <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@elliouros">this site</a>.<br>
my pronouns, to circumvent that link, are <b>she/it</b>. they/them is acceptable, but avoid that if possible.
</div>

<div>
<h3>for some less intuitive information...</h3>
my biggest interests are <b>math and math-related sciences</b> <i>(i.e. phys, parts of chem, and-)</i>, <b>compsci</b> to a varying degree,
and <b>gaming</b>.
